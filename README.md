# NBA All-Star Prediction Using SVM

## Overview
This project employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict potential All-Star players in the NBA for the 2024 season. The model is trained on historical player performance data to identify early-season indicators of All-Star caliber performance.

## Introduction to SVM
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a powerful class of supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes. Imagine you have two types of colored balls on a table and you need to separate them without touching the balls. You might use a stick to draw a line between them. In machine learning terms, the stick is the decision boundary or hyperplane, and the SVM algorithm tries to place this hyperplane in the best way to separate the balls by color, which represent different classes in our data. 

The magic of SVM lies in how it finds this hyperplane. It looks for the widest possible margin between the classes, which means it tries to leave as much room on either side of the hyperplane as possible. This is achieved by using the data points that are closest to the hyperplane, which are known as support vectors. These points are critical as they are the ones defining the margin.

When data isn't easily separable with a straight line, SVM can still come to the rescue. By employing what's called the kernel trick, it can project the data into higher-dimensional spaces where a hyperplane can do the job. This is especially useful for non-linear data.

SVM is used in various real-world applications such as handwriting recognition, face detection, spam filtering, and even in biological sciences for cancer classification. Its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and ensure a degree of separation between classes makes it a versatile and powerful tool in machine learning.


## Dataset
The dataset encompasses player statistics from the 2021-2022 NBA seasons, including age, games played, wins, losses, points, field goals made, and more. The target variable is the binary `ALLSTAR` status.

## Model Training
In this project, we've employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to predict NBA All-Stars. The RBF kernel is a popular choice in SVM models for its capability to handle non-linear data. It essentially transforms the feature space into a higher dimension where it becomes possible to find a hyperplane that can linearly separate the data, which may not be linearly separable in the original space.

The choice of the RBF kernel comes from its flexibility in managing real-world data where the relationship between class labels and attributes is often non-linear. By applying this kernel, the SVM can map the input features into a multidimensional space using a Gaussian function and find a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the classes.

However, before we can train the SVM, we need to preprocess the data to ensure the model performs optimally. This preprocessing includes two key steps: feature scaling and class balancing.

Feature Scaling:
Machine learning algorithms, and SVMs in particular, are sensitive to the range of the data. If one feature has a range from 0 to 1000 while another feature ranges from 0 to 1, the SVM will unfairly weigh the former feature more heavily. This is why we apply feature scaling, which normalizes the range of the features so that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations. In this project, we use standard scaling, which subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation, ensuring that each feature has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Class Imbalance with SMOTE:
A common challenge in classification tasks is class imbalance, which occurs when there are far more instances of some classes than others. In the context of predicting All-Stars, the number of All-Star players is significantly lower than non-All-Stars. Such an imbalance can lead the SVM to be biased towards the majority class. To counter this, we use the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic samples from the minority class by first finding the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space, then selecting neighbors and generating new samples that combine features of the minority instance with features of its neighbors. This technique allows the SVM to have a balanced view of the classes and learn to identify the characteristics of All-Star players more effectively.

By addressing these key aspects of data preprocessing, we lay a strong foundation for the SVM model to learn from the data and make accurate predictions about which players are most likely to be NBA All-Stars.

## Predictions
Predictions are made based on player performance in the early games of the 2024 season. The model is optimized for high recall to ensure minimal false negatives, with the understanding that this may increase false positives.
